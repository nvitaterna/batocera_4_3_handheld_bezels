# batocera_4_3_handheld_bezels

These bezels have been taken from https://github.com/drkhrse/drkhrse_miyoo_bezels and https://github.com/antiKk/muOS-Overlays. I have just created the necessary .info files so they are compatible with Batocera.

## Installation

Copy the decorations folder to the userdata partition of your batocera sd card. Then, go to "Game Settings" and set the decoration set to "rg35xx_bezels" (likely at the bottom of the list).

You may unset any integer scaling options you may have set for these consoles as the .info files will set the integer scaling for you (for the systems with int scaling bezels).

## Acknowledgements
Big thanks to [drkhrse](https://github.com/drkhrse) and [antiKk](https://github.com/antiKk) for creating the original bezels.
